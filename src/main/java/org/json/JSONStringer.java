/**
 * JSONStringer provides a quick and convenient way of producing JSON text.
 * The texts produced strictly conform to JSON syntax rules. No whitespace is
 * added, so the results are ready for transmission or storage. Each instance of
 * JSONStringer can produce one JSON text.
 * <p>
 * A JSONStringer instance provides a <code>value</code> method for appending
 * values to the
 * text, and a <code>key</code>
 * method for adding keys before values in objects. There are <code>array</code>
 * and <code>endArray</code> methods that make and bound array values, and
 * <code>object</code> and <code>endObject</code> methods which make and bound
 * object values. All of these methods return the JSONWriter instance,
 * permitting cascade style. For example, <pre>
 * myString = new JSONStringer()
 *     .object()
 *         .key("JSON")
 *         .value("Hello, World!")
 *     .endObject()
 *     .toString();</pre> which produces the string <pre>
 * {"JSON":"Hello, World!"}</pre>
 * <p>
 * The first method called must be <code>array</code> or <code>object</code>.
 * There are no methods for adding commas or colons. JSONStringer adds them for
 * you. Objects and arrays can be nested up to 20 levels deep.
 * <p>
 * This can sometimes be easier than using a JSONObject to build a string.
